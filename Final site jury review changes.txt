	One student that reviewed my site said, “Possibly touch up the links on the view my profile page, but other than that the site is pretty good.” Another student said, “The main page is good, but the appeal of the links to the profiles could be enhanced.” Clearly it seemed like I needed to touch up the babysitter profiles. To do so I first made sure the babysitter profiles were uniform with the homepage in color and design.  To do so I used the same style sheets that I had for the main page and Incorporated twitter bootstrap components into them by using a circular photo the babysitter profile pictures and added the ability for the user to click on their email which would open up the users email app with an email being sent to the babysitter. I also incorporated bootstraps columns. The babysitter profile picture and email are in a column on the left side of the screen and on the right is the babysitters full bio which I show a snippet of in the main screen. 	Most of the students who reviewed my site said they would not visit my site again. To fix this issue I added forms to the site to make it more interactive. I added two buttons to the navbar in the main page. One links to a form for users to review babysitters. Those who have wrote reviews would now be more likely to revisit the site after to see if their review got put up. The other button I added to the navbar links the user to a form to be listed as a babysitter on the site. Now any user can be listed as a babysitter (..with a profile picture!) If the user makes a babysitter profile they would be sure to revisit the site to see how they are being reviewed. 	Another student also said my main page could have more more words and descriptions on the front page. Another student also said my site was not scannable, so this put me in a bit of a pickle. I decided to add a more informative description about the website on the jumbotron but I didn’t want to add too much so as to make the website less scanable.
